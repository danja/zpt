**Abstract:** This study presents energy-efficient algorithms for data center operations, reducing power consumption by 30% while maintaining computational performance.

## Introduction

Data centers consume approximately 1% of global electricity, making energy efficiency critical for environmental sustainability. Traditional algorithms prioritize computational speed over energy consumption, leading to significant environmental impact.

## Literature Review

Previous work in green computing focused primarily on hardware optimization. Recent algorithmic approaches include:
- Dynamic voltage scaling (Brooks & Martonosi, 2001)
- Task scheduling for energy efficiency (Koomey et al., 2011)
- Machine learning for power management (Chen et al., 2023)

## Proposed Approach

Our framework introduces three key innovations:

### 1. Adaptive Load Balancing
Dynamic workload distribution based on real-time energy costs and renewable energy availability.

### 2. Predictive Power Management
Machine learning models predict energy demand and optimize resource allocation 24 hours in advance.

### 3. Carbon-Aware Scheduling
Tasks are scheduled to maximize use of renewable energy sources, reducing carbon footprint.

## Experimental Setup

We evaluated our approach across three data center configurations:
- Small-scale (100 servers)
- Medium-scale (1,000 servers)  
- Large-scale (10,000 servers)

## Results

| Configuration | Energy Reduction | Performance Impact | Carbon Savings |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Small-scale | 28% | 2% slower | 25% |
| Medium-scale | 32% | 1% slower | 30% |
| Large-scale | 35% | 0.5% slower | 33% |

## Conclusion

Green algorithms represent a crucial step toward sustainable computing. Our results demonstrate significant energy savings with minimal performance impact, supporting widespread adoption.
